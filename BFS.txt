#Function Body-

bfs(Graph, StartNode):

	visited = []  <- Initialise List for visited nodes  
	queue = []   <-  Initialize a queue for for storing nodes to explore

	Add StartNode to Visited 
	Add StartNode to Queue 

	While Queue is not empty:
		Remove the last element of queue
		CurrentNode <- Initialise  and store the  removed element      
		print (CurrentNode, with a space at the end)

		For each Neighbor of CurrentNode in the graph:
		If Neighbor is not in Visited:
			Add Neighbor to Visited
			Add Neighbor to Queue
